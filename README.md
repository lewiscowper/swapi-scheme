# swapico-scheme
Scheme library for the Star Wars API (http://swapi.co/)

At the moment only the planet endpoint is defined, I'm going to make the whole thing a bit more generic and then I'll create (resource id) style methods for getById style functionality, and then (resource) for get all, and (resource-schema) for getting the JSON schema of the endpoint.

Once that is done, I'll move on to adding validation that (resource) belongs to (endpoints), and then I'll get to look in on how error handling works.
